# How Workflows Are Structured in n8n

n8n workflows are visual representations of automated processes, composed of interconnected nodes that perform specific tasks. Understanding the structure of workflows is essential for designing efficient and effective automations.

## Workflow Components

### 1. Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of workflows. Each node performs a specific operation, such as retrieving data from an API, processing data, or sending an email. Nodes can be categorized into:

- **Trigger Nodes:** Initiate workflows based on specific events (e.g., receiving a webhook, a scheduled time).
- **Action Nodes:** Perform tasks like data transformation, API requests, or sending messages.

### 2. Connections

Connections define the flow of data between nodes. They determine the sequence in which nodes execute and how data is passed along the workflow.

To create a connection between two nodes:
1. Click on the output port (right side) of the source node.
2. Drag the connection line to the input port (left side) of the target node.

### 3. Sticky Notes

Sticky notes are annotations that can be added to workflows to provide context or explanations, aiding in documentation and collaboration.

## Workflow Execution Flow

1. **Initiation:** A trigger node activates the workflow upon detecting a predefined event.
2. **Sequential Execution:** Nodes execute in the order defined by their connections, processing and passing data along the chain.
3. **Conditional Logic:** Nodes like "IF" or "Switch" can introduce branching, allowing different execution paths based on data conditions.
4. **Loops and Iterations:** Nodes can be configured to process multiple items or repeat actions until certain conditions are met.
5. **Completion:** The workflow concludes once all nodes have executed their tasks.

## Flow Logic

n8n allows you to represent complex logic in your workflows, including:

- **Splitting with Conditionals:** Use the "IF" or "Switch" nodes to create branches based on conditions.
- **Merging Data:** Combine data from multiple branches using the "Merge" node.
- **Looping:** Use the "Loop Over Items" node to iterate over a list of items.
- **Waiting:** Introduce delays or wait for specific conditions using the "Wait" node.
- **Sub-Workflows:** Modularize workflows by calling sub-workflows using the "Execute Workflow" node.
- **Error Handling:** Manage errors gracefully using the "Error Trigger" node.

## Execution Order in Multi-Branch Workflows

In workflows with multiple branches, n8n executes branches based on their position on the canvas:

- **Top-to-Bottom:** Branches are executed from top to bottom.
- **Left-to-Right:** If branches are at the same vertical position, execution proceeds from left to right.

You can change the execution order in your workflow settings.

## Data Structure

n8n processes data in the form of items, where each item is a JSON object. Nodes receive input data, process it, and pass the output to the next node. Understanding the data structure is crucial for effective data mapping and transformation within workflows.

## Best Practices

- **Modularity:** Break complex workflows into smaller, manageable sub-workflows for clarity and reusability.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error-handling nodes to manage exceptions and ensure robustness.
- **Documentation:** Use sticky notes and clear naming conventions to make workflows understandable to collaborators.
- **Testing:** Regularly test workflows to validate functionality and catch issues early.
